A pharmaceutical company was experiencing a **rising number of defective pill batches**, but the root cause was unknown. This issue not only **slowed production** but also **threatened the company’s ability to meet demand**, putting revenue at risk.

To solve the problem, the company needed to:

- 🔑 Identify the **key factors** causing defective batches.
- 💯 Find **quantifiable solutions** to optimize production and reduce waste.

To tackle this, I applied **Machine Learning** techniques to analyze production data and detect patterns in defect occurrences.

- 📏 Trained **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Decision Trees, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XG-Boost)** to predict defective batches.
- 💪🏼 Analyzed models to determine *which variables and their values* had the **strongest influence** on defects.
